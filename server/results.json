      "answer": "It's impossible to provide specific Tunisian faculties based solely on the student's preferences for \"Chambre à la maison\" (Room at home) and \"Clubs académiques\" (Academic Clubs). \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Too little information:**  These preferences don't reveal anything about the student's academic interests, desired career path, or specific subjects they enjoy. \n* **\"Chambre à la maison\" is a general preference:** It's not directly related to a specific field of study.\n* **\"Clubs académiques\" is broad:**  Academic clubs exist in nearly every faculty. It doesn't point towards a specific area.\n\n**To provide meaningful suggestions, we need more information about the student's interests and goals.  **\n\nFor example, we need to know:\n\n* **What subjects does the student enjoy?** (Math, science, humanities, arts, etc.)\n* **What kind of career is the student interested in?** (Medicine, engineering, law, business, etc.)\n* **Does the student prefer a theoretical or practical education?** \n\nOnce we have this information, we can provide a more accurate list of faculties with corresponding compatibility percentages and explanations. \n"
